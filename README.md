## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone this repository.

2.  The `data/` folder is ignored since it is too large. You need to create it yourself:
    ```bash
    mkdir data
    ```

3.  Obtain the necessary data files from source and place them in the `data/` folder.
    The required files are:
    - `data/raw/unclean_Nepali_text_corpus_ieee.txt`    (read-only)
    - `data/processed/clean_Nepali_text_corpus_ieee.txt` (generated by scripts/clean_process.py)
    - `data/inflected/inflected_pairs.txt`  (generated by scripts/error_generation.py)
